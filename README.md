## Running this Program

You'll need to have `Music21`, `PyAudio`, `NumPy`, `Pygame`, and Python 3 installed. All of these are easily installable with `pip`.

Once that's setup, you'll run the program, strike your wine glass, and then press spacebar to begin playing back the detected frequency. If your speakers are loud enough, your wine glass should break!
